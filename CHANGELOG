    Deployed the app via React + Vite.

    Coding out the skeleton for the app as a base.

    Added the Help modal to describe how to use the app.

    Enabling the Run button but not the full function yet.

    The Run button prototype supports interactive query analysis, dynamically generating logical execution steps and visual plans in response to user input.

    Planning to make small upgrades to Run to highlight steps and nodes more informatively.
